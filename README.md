# CVE ID
CVE-2024-30727

# Title
Information Leakage in ROS Kinetic Kame via Plaintext Message Transmission

# Vulnerability Type
Information Leakage and Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data

# Severity
TBD

# Vendor
The Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF)

# Products Affected
ROS Kinetic Kame (ROS_VERSION=1 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3)

# Description
A critical vulnerability has been discovered in ROS Kinetic Kame, where the system transmits messages in plaintext. This flaw exposes sensitive information, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and allowing attackers to easily intercept and access this data.

# Impact
Information Leakage; 
Data Integrity Concerns; 
Loss of Trust; 
Operational Disruption; 
Broader Network Compromise.

# Attack Vector
The vulnerability can be exploited through network sniffing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and unauthorized network access.

# Solution
To address this vulnerability, it is essential to implement secure communication protocols that encrypt data during transmission. Users should update to a version of ROS that provides these security measures or apply available patches that rectify this issue.

# Workaround
In the absence of an immediate solution, users should employ network security measures such as VPNs, monitor network traffic for unusual patterns indicative of eavesdropping, and ensure sensitive data is encrypted at the application level.

# CVE Status
Confirmed and published.
